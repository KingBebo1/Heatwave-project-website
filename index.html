         <h2>Hazard Warnings</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>NWS Heat Alerts (Advisory, Watch, and Warning)
          <ul>
            <li><b>Heat Advisory</b>: Issued within 12 hours of dangerous heat conditions that are expected or occurring, but not severe enough to meet warning criteria. It is recommended to take action.</li><br>
            <li><b>Extreme Heat Watch</b>: Issued when conditions are favorable for an extreme heat event within the next 24 to 72 hours, but its timing and occurrence are still uncertain. This lets people and communities have time to prepare for the heatwave.</li><br>
            <li><b>Extreme Heat Warning</b>: Issued within 12 to 24 hours before the onset of extremely dangerous, life-threatening heat conditions. This is the highest alert level, urging the public to take immediate action, such as avoiding outdoor activities, and staying in air-conditioned spaces. </li>
          </ul>
          </li><br>
         
          <li>The HeatRisk tool
          <ul>
            <li><b>System Details</b>: This tool combines NWS weather forecasts with CDC health data to determine the risk of heat-related illness at a local level. The risk level is location-specific, as what is dangerous in one region may be normal in another.</li><br>
            <li><b>Purpose</b>: It helps public health officials and the general public tell how much of a risk it is and have them do the proper steps to prepare. </li>
          </ul>
          </li><br>
         
          <li>Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT) Monitoring
          <ul>
            <li><b>System Details</b>: WBGT accounts for temperature, humidity, wind speed, and solar radiation, providing a comprehensive measure of the heat stress on the human body.</li><br>
            <li><b>Purpose</b>: It is used as a preventive measure to inform activity modifications for active populations, such as outdoor workers and athletes, by setting limits on certain workouts or activities. </li>

      <!--How it works-->
      <h2>How it works</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>High-pressure systems force air downward</li>
        <li>The force prevents air near the ground from rising</li>
        <li>The sinking air acts like a cap</li>
        <li>It traps warm ground air in place</li>
        <li>Without rising air, there is no rain and nothing to prevent it from getting hotter</li>

      <!--PREPAREDNESS STRATEGIED-->
      <h2>How to prepare</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Prepare your home for for cooling and heat reduction
        <ul>
          <li>Service your air conditioner in spring, clean AC coils, trim around outdoor units for airflow, and use fans efficiently. If you lack AC, you can use weather-strip doors/windows, cover them with shades/drapes, and/or use window reflectors (like foil-covered cardboard) to block sun. Reduce indoor heat by using ovens less and cooking cool meals.
</li>
        </ul>
        </li><br>
       
        <li>Stay hydrated and dress smart
        <ul>
        <li>Drink plenty of fluids (water, sports drinks) before feeling thirsty, especially if active or outdoors. Avoid alcohol and sugary drinks. Wear loose-fitting, make sure you wear light clothing and hats with brims to cover your face.</li>  
        </ul>
        </li><br>
       
        <li>Adjust activity and seek cool spaces
        <ul>
          <li>Reschedule big activities or errands for early mornings or late evenings. If you must go out, stay in the shade, slow down, and take frequent breaks. Know the location of local cooling centers or public buildings with good AC.</li>
        </ul>
        </li><br>
       
        <li>Check on others and know heat illness signs
        <ul>
          <li>Develop a buddy system; check on elderly family, neighbors, and vulnerable individuals. Learn symptoms of heat cramps, exhaustion, and stroke (dizziness, nausea, rapid pulse, confusion).<b>Call 911 immediately</b> if someone shows signs of serious heat illness and begin cooling measures.
</li>
        </ul>

      <!--SAFETY PROCEDURES-->
      <h2>Safety Procedures</h2>

      <img src="Heatwave-2.jpg" width="350">
     
      <ol>
        <li> Proactive Hydration and Cooling (Personal Preparedness)
          <ul>
            <li><b>Hydration</b>: The goal is to prevent dehydration before it starts. People should drink water consistently throughout the day, rather than waiting until they feel thirsty. During intense heat, the body loses significant amounts of water and electrolytes through sweat. Water is typically sufficient, but those engaged in difficult activity may benefit from sports drinks. Crucially, one must avoid sugary drinks, alcohol, and caffeine, as these can lead to dehydration .
</li><br>
          <li>Cooling
          <ul>
            <li><b>Stay Indoors</b>: The primary action is to stay in an air-conditioned environment. If your home doesn't have AC, utilize public cooling centers, such as libraries, malls, or designated community centers.</li>
            <br><li><b>Dress Appropriately</b>: Wear lightweight, loose-fitting, and light-colored clothing to reflect sunlight and allow sweat to evaporate.</li>
            <br><li><b>Cool Showers/Baths</b>: Regularly taking cool showers or baths helps lower the body's temperature. </li>
          </ul>
          </li>
          </ul>
        </li><br>
       
        <li>Minimizing Heat Exposure and Modifying Activity (Environmental Awareness)
        <ul>
          <li><b>Avoid Peak Hours</b>: Limit outdoor activities and difficult work to the coolest parts of the day, typically before 6 a.m. and after 6 p.m. . The sun is most intense between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m..</li><br>
          <li><b>Modify Intensity</b>: If outdoor activity is unavoidable, reduce the intensity and the amount of  time you take. Take frequent breaks in a shaded or air-conditioned area to allow the body time to recover.</li><br>
          <li><b>Use Sun Protection</b>: When outdoors, use sunscreen with an appropriate SPF rating to prevent sunburn, which affects the body's ability to cool itself.</li><br>
          <li><b>"Look Before You Lock"</b>: Never leave children or pets unattended in vehicles. Interior car temperatures can reach lethal levels in minutes, even with windows cracked. </li>
        </ul>
        </li><br>
       
        <li>Monitoring Vulnerable Populations and Recognizing Symptoms (Community Response)
        <ul>


      <li><b>Symptom Recognition</b>: Educate all members of the community on the signs of heat exhaustion and heat stroke.<br>
        <ul>
          <li>Heat Exhaustion signs include heavy sweating, weakness, cool/pale/clammy skin, fast weak pulse, nausea, and fainting . This requires moving the person to a cool place, loosening clothing, and having them drink water.</li><br>
          <li>Heat Stroke is a life-threatening emergency. Signs include high body temperature (above 103°F), hot/red/dry skin (no sweating), rapid strong pulse, and potential unconsciousness. <b>Call 911 immediately</b> if these symptoms are present .</li><br>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><b>Emergency Preparedness</b>: Have an emergency kit ready with essential items like water, non-perishable food, and a first-aid kit. Make sure all electronic devices in case of power outages that may occur due to high AC usage. Information on general heat safety and preparing an emergency kit is available on the CDC website. </li>
        </ul>

      <!--INFORMATIONAL FACTS-->
      <h2>Facts</h2>
     
      <ul>
        <li><b>In July 1995, Chicago, Illinois experienced a heat wave that caused over 700 deaths.</b> Scientists predict that the Midwest could endure similar heat waves up to 3 times a year by 2100 if greenhouse gas emissions continue to increase.</li><br>
        <li><b>Climate change is increasing their frequency and intensity</b>. Scientific evidence, supported by data from agencies like NASA and NOAA, indicates that human-caused climate change is making heatwaves more common, longer, and more severe. Warmer baseline temperatures mean that heatwaves start from a higher temperature point, making record-breaking events more likely.</li><br>
        <li><b>Heat is the leading cause of weather-related deaths</b>. In the United States, heatwaves cause more fatalities on average than all other weather-related disasters, such as floods, tornadoes, and hurricanes, combined. Globally, thousands of excess deaths are attributed to heatwaves each year, with extreme events like the 2003 European heatwave linked to over 70,000 deaths.</li><br>
        <li><b>High humidity exacerbates health risks</b>. The human body cools itself by sweating, but when humidity is high, sweat evaporates more slowly, making it difficult for the body to regulate its internal temperature. This inability to cool down increases the risk of serious conditions like heat exhaustion and heat stroke.</li><br>
        <li><b>Urban areas experience an "urban heat island" effect</b>. Cities, with their dense infrastructure of asphalt and concrete and limited green spaces, absorb and retain more heat than surrounding rural areas. This effect makes heatwaves more intense and dangerous in metropolitan areas, particularly at night when the retained heat is slowly released, preventing overnight cooling.</li><br>
        <li><b>Heatwaves severely impact infrastructure and agriculture</b>. Extreme heat can cause physical damage, such as buckling road pavement and warping railway tracks. In agriculture, high temperatures stress crops and livestock, leading to reduced yields and economic losses. Increased demand for air conditioning also strains electrical grids, often resulting in power outages during the most critical times. </li>
