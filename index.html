      <!--Hazard Warnings-->
      <h2>Hazard Warnings</h2>
      
      <div id="hazard-warnings">
        <ul>
          <li>NWS Heat Alerts (Advisory, Watch, and Warning)
          <ul>
            <li><b>Heat Advisory</b>: Issued within 12 hours of dangerous heat conditions that are expected or occurring, but not severe enough to meet warning criteria. The public is advised to take action, such as staying hydrated and finding cool indoor areas.</li><br>
            <li><b>Extreme Heat Watch</b>: Issued when conditions are favorable for an extreme heat event within the next 24 to 72 hours, but its timing and occurrence are still uncertain. This provides lead time for individuals and communities to prepare plans, such as locating cooling centers.</li><br>
            <li><b>Extreme Heat Warning</b>: Issued within 12 to 24 hours before the onset of extremely dangerous, life-threatening heat conditions. This is the highest alert level, urging the public to take immediate action, such as avoiding outdoor activities, staying in air-conditioned spaces, and checking on vulnerable neighbors and family. </li>
          </ul>
          </li><br>
          
          <li>The HeatRisk tool
          <ul>
            <li><b>System Details</b>: This tool combines NWS weather forecasts with CDC health data to determine the risk of heat-related illness at a local level. The risk level is location-specific, as what is dangerous in one region may be normal in another.</li><br>
            <li><b>Purpose</b>: It helps public health officials and the general public assess the risk and initiate appropriate preparedness and response actions before a heat event becomes imminent. </li>
          </ul>
          </li><br>
          
          <li>Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT) Monitoring 
          <ul>
            <li><b>System Details</b>: WBGT accounts for temperature, humidity, wind speed, and solar radiation, providing a comprehensive measure of the heat stress on the human body.</li><br>
            <li><b>Purpose</b>: It is used as a preventive measure to inform activity modifications for active populations, such as outdoor workers and athletes, by setting specific thresholds for work/rest cycles or suspending activities as the WBGT rises. </li>
          </ul>
          </li>

      <!--How it works-->
      <h2>How it works</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>High-pressure systems force air downward</li>
        <li>The force prevents air near the ground from rising</li>
        <li>The sinking air acts like a cap</li>
        <li>It traps warm ground air in place</li>
        <li>Without rising air, there is no rain and nothing to prevent it from getting hotter</li>
      </ol>
      
      <hr>
      <!--PREPAREDNESS STRATEGIED-->
      <h2>How to prepare</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Prepare your home for for cooling and heat reduction
        <ul>
          <li>Service your air conditioner in spring, clean AC coils, trim around outdoor units for airflow, and use fans efficiently. If you lack AC, weather-strip doors/windows, cover them with shades/drapes, and use window reflectors (like foil-covered cardboard) to block sun. Reduce indoor heat by using ovens less and cooking cool meals.
</li>
        </ul>
        </li><br>
        
        <li>Stay hydrated and dress smart
        <ul>
        <li>Drink plenty of fluids (water, sports drinks) before feeling thirsty, especially if active or outdoors. Avoid alcohol and sugary drinks. Wear loose-fitting, light-colored clothing and wide-brimmed hats to reflect sun and keep cool.</li>  
        </ul>
        </li><br>
        
        <li>Adjust activity and seek cool spaces
        <ul>
          <li>Reschedule strenuous activities or errands for early mornings or late evenings. If you must go out, stay in the shade, slow down, and take frequent breaks. Know the location of local cooling centers or public libraries with AC.</li>
        </ul>
        </li><br>
        
        <li>Check on others and know heat illness signs
        <ul>
          <li>Develop a buddy system; check on elderly family, neighbors, and vulnerable individuals. Learn symptoms of heat cramps, exhaustion, and stroke (dizziness, nausea, rapid pulse, confusion). Call 911 immediately if someone shows signs of serious heat illness and begin cooling measures.
